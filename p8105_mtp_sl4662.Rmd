# Problem 1

Some age group does not match the age. Age group 1 is not suppose to appear, and there is an age 45, with age group 1.

This dataset is consist of many different variables, and some variables have conclusive variables following them to classify the results into different groups. 

Key variables include :

There are `r ncol(mtp_data)` variables and `r nrow(mtp_data)` observations in this data set. There is a total of `r nrow(mtp_data)` participants.
